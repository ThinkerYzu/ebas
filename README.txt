ebas is an assembler for Extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF)
programs. It helps you write and compile eBPF programs that can run on
Linux systems. You can use it by typing in the command
"./target/debug/ebas <input-file> <output-file>" followed by the name
of your input file and output file, then press enter. The assembler
will help you create a program that can be used in Linux systems.

## Instructions
There are three major caegories of instructions.

 - Load and Store
 - Arithmatic
 - Jump

There are 10 64-bits general purpose registers. `r0`, `r1`, ..., `r91.
`r10` is a read-only frame pointer to access stack.

### Load and Store

Load instructions are used to load data from a memory address to a
register.  Contrastly, store instructions copies the value of a
register to a memory address.

You can load 4 different size of data from memory.

 - `ld.b` loads 1 byte

 - `ld.h` loads 2 bytes

 - `ld.w` loads 4 bytes

 - `ld.dw` loads 8 bytes

For every `ld` instructions, it loads data to a register. For example,

 - `ld.b r1, r2` loads one byte from the address given by the register
   `r2` to the register `r1`.

 - `ld.h r1, r2 + 4` loads 2 bytes from the address given by `r2`
   with an offset `4`.

`ld.dw` has a special function to load an 8 bytes immediate value to a
register.  `ld.b`, `ld.h`, and `ld.w` can load an immediate value.

 - `ld.dw r1, 0xffffffffffffffff` loads `0xffffffffffffffff` (8 bytes
   immediate value) to `r1`.

You can store 4 different size of data to memory as well.

 - `st.b` is an 1 byte instruction

 - `st.h` is a 2 bytes instruction

 - `st.w` is a 4 bytes instruction

 - `st.dw` is a 8 bytes instruction

`st` instructions can use data from a register or an immediate value
(32-bits at most).

 - `st.b r1, r2` read the lowest byte of r2 and store it to the
   address given by `r1`.

 - `st.w r1 + 4, r2` read the lowest 4 bytes of r2 and store them to
   the address given by `r1` with an offset `4`.

 - `st.w r1 + 8, 0xdeadbeef` store `0xdeadbeef` to the address given
   by `r1` with an offset `8`.

### Arithmatic

Following are arithmatic instructions.

 - `add` add two operands and keep the result at the first register.

 - `sub` substract two operands and keep the result at the first
   reigster.

 - `mul` multiples two operands.

 - `div` divides first operand by the second operand.

 - `or`

 - `and`

 - `lsh` bitwise shifts the first operand left with by n-bits given by
   the second operand.

 - `rsh` bitwise shifts the first operand right.

 - `neg` do bitwise not on the second operand and store the result at
   the first register.

 - `mod` modulo.

 - `xor`

 - `arsh` do sign-aware shift right.

 - `end` do byte swapping.

 - `mov` moves the value of the second operand to the first register.

The second operand should be a register or a 32-bits immediate value.

 - `add r1, r2` adds `r2` to `r1`.

 - `add r1, 0xff` adds `0xff` to `r1`.

 - `mov r1, r3` move the value of `r3` to `r1`.

 - `mov r1, 0x1f1f` move `0x1f1f` (32-bits) to `r1`.

All these instructions are 3-bits.  They read 32-bits from both
operands, but write to the first operand, a register, as a 64-bits
value.

There are 64-bits versions to read 64-bits from both operands.

 - `add.64 r1, r2` adds the 64-bits value of `r2` to `r1`.

 - `div.64 r1, r2` divide `r1` with the 64-bits value of `r2`.

 - `div.64 r1, r2` move the 64-bits value of `r2` to `r1`.

However, you can not use 64-bits immedate value.

### Jump

Most jump instructions compare two operand and jump to the location
given by an offset related PC.

 - `ja` is an unconditional jump.

 - `jeq` jump if two operands are equal.

 - `jgt` jump if the first operand is greater than the second one.

 - `jge` jump if the first operand is greater than or equal to the
   second one.

 - `jset` jump if any bits set in the first operand is also set in the
   second one.

 - `jne` jump if two operands are not equal.

 - `jsgt` jump if the first operand is greater than the second one
   (signed).

 - `jsge` jump if the first operand is greater than or equal to the
   second one (signed).

 - `jlt` jump if the first operand is lesser than the second one.

 - `jle` jump if the first operand is lesser than or equal to the
   second one.

 - `jslt` jump if the first operand is lesser than the second one
   (signed).

 - `jsle` jump if the first operand is lesser than or equal to the
   second one (signed).
