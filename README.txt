ebas is an assembler for Extended Berkeley Packet Filtering (eBPF)
programs. It helps you write and compile eBPF programs that can run on
Linux systems. You can use it by typing in the command
"./target/debug/ebas <input-file> <output-file>" followed by the name
of your input file and output file, then press enter. The assembler
will help you create a program that can be used in Linux systems.
